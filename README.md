# react-ts-sudoko
### A simple sudoko game made with Reactjs and Typescript

## Setup

This project was bundled with vite, so it follows the default vite commands

- `npm run dev`: Starts the project on a local web server
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production
- `npm run preview` Starts a local web server and hosts the production site on it. You need to run the second command before this one.
